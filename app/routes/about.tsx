            George received his BA in Economics and Business from UMASS Boston
            and his MBA from the Arthur D. Little Management Education
            Institute. During that time, he learned from leading consultants how
            to build a top-notch team and lead the way with innovation and
            proactive team management.
            <br />
            <br />
            From 1995 to 2000 he worked for the NYC Board of Education where he
            gained experience in complex project management, budgeting, and the
            ins and outs of how various agencies operate and function.
            <br />
            <br />
            Prior to joining Allcon he worked at MAA as a project manager.
            Throughout those 8 years he worked on a variety of complex projects
            and gained construction experience that supplemented and
            strengthened his management expertise.
            <br />
            <br />
            In 2009 George joined Allcon Contracting as a partner. With his
            well-rounded experience in construction, administration, finance,
            and staff and project management, he was able to help build a
            knowledgeable, efficient, and effective team of managers. This
            helped advance Allcon to be a respected leader in the construction
            industry. With his leadership, Allcon has created a corporate
            culture of trust from our clients as well as our employees.

        father John at Bistakis Corp. on weekends and summer vacations. During
        that time, Marko eagerly absorbed all the rudiments of the construction
        business as well as character building qualities of good work ethic,
        honesty, integrity, and the importance of delivering a finished product.

        years of experience in construction and knows that every component of
        the business, from estimating, project management, client contact and
        human resources, are responsible for both corporate and project success.
