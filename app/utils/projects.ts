    description: `  Allcon constructed this uniquely designed 90,000sf copper roof which now
      transforms Lupton Hall into a landmark for the SUNY Farmingdale Campus.
      Allcon proposed and helped developed a distinctive structural design
      during the initial removal and abatement stages of the project. The
      structural design included a high gauge metal framing system that
      bypasses the concrete deck and attaches to the existing framing
      structure with blind bolts. Craftsmanship is found throughout the roof
      from the artfully fabricated dormers to the carefully sculpted gutter
      system designed to withstands wind speed up to 126 mph. Allcon made sure
      that the copper fabrication was a mix of machine fabrication for the
      panels to control cost and hard created units for the fine intricate
      detail work. This inspiration assignment is not just a showcase project
      for Allcon but a signature piece of work for Farmingdale’s dedication to
      excellence on campus.`,

        included the restoration of an existing salt shed, the construction of a
        new heavy timer shed, new vehicle service and storage building as well
        as the new operations office. Allcon performed more than 60% of the
        general contracting work on this project which included interior
        finishes, masonry, millwork, and metal panel installation. We worked
        closely with Laland Baptiste who served as the CM on the project. Both
        companies built on a spirit of collaboration to make sure a     building was assembled for both NYS OGS the contract manager and the NYS
        Department of Transportation. This was the second project collaboration
        between Allcon and Laland Baptiste and that team spirit proved
        invaluable at addressing unforeseen field conditions, addressing issues
        as they arose and maintain both schedule constraints and budgetary
        limitations.`,

        ALLCON’s was selected to construct a new state of the art Police
        headquarters for the Village of Rockville Center located at the former
        Municipal Water Dept. building. The new facility replaced the old,
        outdated, and cramped facility located on Maple Avenue. ALLCON’s work
        included demolition of all interior components and asbestos abatement.
        The construction included new CMU walls, stud framed walls, and ACT
        ceilings. The team also built new secure holding cells and sally ports.
        Our flooring experts installed a combination of carpet, LVT, and ceramic
        tiles throughout. The Allcon team manufactured and installed custom
        millwork counters throughout the facility. New wood doors, wood-clad
        windows, and roll-up gates were installed to rejuvenate the building’s
        exterior and provide the necessary security. Lastly, exterior new
        signage and aluminum metal panels were installed, as well as a handicap
        lift to provide needed public access to the facilty.

      from the Ocean waters, this project was required as a result of sever
      damages incurred during Superstorm Sandy. Allcon constructed two 3,000
      sf infrastructure building additions on top of the existing parking
      structure/ promenade to house the facilities new boilers, hot water
      heaters, electrical services, and new generator system. This 18 story,
      192-unit apartment building for the elderly was fully occupied during
      construction and required extensive coordination between Allcon and the
      construction manager. Complete window and balcony door replacement was
      required as well as over 15,000 sf of built-up roofing and 35,000 sf of
      unit pavers throughout the building. Through close collaboration with
      the CM and building occupants Allcon was able to complete this project

    description: `
        Allcon was selected by Success Academy Charter Schools as the General
        Contractor to complete full renovations of interior spaces throughout
        the school system. The projects were done at an extremely rapid pace at
        multiple facilities and required quick mobilization of the work force
        and constant coordination between Allcon, the owner and design team to
        meet the 4 week completion schedule. The collaborative approach between
        these parties was a major component for the programs success. Allcon
        worked with suppliers to obtain and secure materials in advance of the
        actual work starting. Allcon was able to secure what are typically long
        lead items by preplanning the construction and preparing deliveries
        prior to the summer period when work was required to be completed. Over
        a period of five years Allcon delivered state of the art classroom
        spaces which included mechanical, electrical and plumbing systems
        upgrades.

      project was being conducted along a busy NYC street, pedestrian
      protection was planned and installed to a secure work site and assure
      efficient access to complete the work on a tight time schedule. Allcon
      modified the existing structure by removing a n existing stair and
      installing new wood joist and subfloor. A decorative tin ceiling was
      installed by Allcon craftsmen and reclaimed wood planks were fitted
      throughout the restaurant. Fire rated materials were installed in-order
      to establish the required fire rating between the first-floor restaurant
      and residential apartments above. Masonry openings were modified to
      provide the required access to both the restaurant and apartments above.
      Allcon provided all the required MEP systems, filtration and Fire
      Protection required for the fit-out and installed all furniture and
      equipment through close coordination with the owner. This project was
      the first of two Bareburger restaurant projects successfully completed
