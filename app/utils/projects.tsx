        ALLCON was selected by Success Academy Charter Schools as the General
        Contractor to complete full renovations of interior spaces throughout
        the school system. The projects were done at an extremely rapid pace at
        multiple facilities and required quick mobilization of the work force
        and constant coordination between ALLCON, the owner and design team to
        meet the 4 week completion schedule. The collaborative approach between
        these parties was a major component for the programs success. ALLCON
        worked with suppliers to obtain and secure materials in advance of the
        actual work starting. ALLCON was able to secure what are typically long
        lead items by preplanning the construction and preparing deliveries
        prior to the summer period when work was required to be completed. Over
        a period of five years Allcon delivered state of the art classroom
        spaces which included mechanical, electrical and plumbing systems
        upgrades.

        ALLCON’s was selected to construct a new state of the art Police
        headquarters for the Village of Rockville Center located at the former

        outdated, and cramped facility located on Maple Avenue. ALLCON’s work
        included demolition of all interior components and asbestos abatement.
        The construction included new CMU walls, stud framed walls, and ACT
        ceilings. The team also built new secure holding cells and sally ports.
        Our flooring experts installed a combination of carpet, LVT, and ceramic
        tiles throughout. The ALLCON team manufactured and installed custom
        millwork counters throughout the facility. New wood doors, wood-clad
        windows, and roll-up gates were installed to rejuvenate the building’s
        exterior and provide the necessary security. Lastly, exterior new
        signage and aluminum metal panels were installed, as well as a handicap
        lift to provide needed public access to the facilty.

        from the artfully fabricated dormers to the carefully sculpted gutter
        system designed to withstands wind speed up to 126 mph. ALLCON made sure
        that the copper fabrication was a mix of machine fabrication for the
        panels to control cost and hard created units for the fine intricate
        detail work. This inspiration assignment is not just a showcase project
